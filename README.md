CSS Snippets for Discord, Vencord QuickCSS (Desktop &amp; Web) or Stylus (Extension) are recommended.

- You Can either use **@import** or paste the entire thing, both work.

- **Customize Clyde** (Also known as Clyde To Viggy) was made by discord user **krekevyks1337 (237616896948699136)**! all I did was fix it and make it easier to customize.
